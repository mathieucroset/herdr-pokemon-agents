# Pokémon agents

A strip along the bottom of the Herdr window where every agent is a pixel-art
Pokémon from the first 151. Working agents walk back and forth, idle ones
stroll and fall asleep after a while, a blocked agent stops and shows a
pulsing "!", and a finished one shows a "✓". Click a Pokémon to jump to its
agent; right-click it to choose which Pokémon it is.

## What you see

- **One strip, 112 px tall**, full width, at the bottom of the window's main
  column (above the status bar in the default layout). Background is the
  theme's `chrome`. A 1 px `border` line runs across it 20 px above the
  bottom: the ground.
- **One Pokémon per agent**, standing on the ground line in a 128 px wide
  column. Sprites come from PMD SpriteCollab sheets, pixel-doubled (2×) with
  nearest-neighbour scaling; Pokémon whose walk frame is taller than 64 px
  (Onix, Gyarados, ...) are drawn at 1×. Each has a soft shadow ellipse
  (`#00000030`, 6 px tall, 70 % of the sprite's visible width) under its feet.
  The sprite is aligned by its visible pixels: feet on the ground, body
  centered on the column.
- **Configurable size**: set `content.props.scale` to a positive finite number
  (default `1`) to multiply the displayed sprite, shadow and loading Poké Ball
  sizes. Feet stay on the ground and bubbles follow the scaled head height.
  Name tags and picker icons keep their size. Missing or invalid values use
  `1`; increase the block height for larger Pokémon.
- **A name tag** under each Pokémon, 10.5 px text in `muted` (`foreground`
  when hovered or focused), preceded by a 6 px dot in the agent's status color
  (`theme().working | blocked | done | idle`). The tag is the tab's name when
  the tab was named, otherwise the space's name. Hovered, it reads
  `<Pokémon> · <tag>`. Tags never overlap: when two would collide, the one
  that matters more stays (hovered > blocked > done > focused > the rest).
- **Bubbles above the head**, 12.5 px bold white on a 7 px-rounded pill:
  `!` on `blocked` (opacity pulse 0.7 ↔ 1 every 900 ms), `✓` on `done`.
  A sleeping Pokémon shows `z` → `zZ` → `zZz` → `zZ` in `muted`, 700 ms apart.
- **While a sprite downloads**, a small Poké Ball (18 px circle, red
  `#e3350d` top, `#f4f4f4` bottom, `foreground` outline) pulses in its place.
- **No agents**: centered 12 px `dim` text, "No agents yet. Each agent you
  start shows up here as a Pokémon."
- **No ImageMagick**: Poké Balls stay, and a note at the top right says
  "Install ImageMagick (magick) to see the Pokémon".
- **The picker** (dialog, 640×560): title "Choose a Pokémon" (15 px
  semibold), a line "for <tag> · now <Pokémon>", a search input with an
  `accent` border, then a scrolling grid of all 151 in Pokédex order: 92×96
  cells with the Gen VII menu icon (80×60), `#025` in `dim` and the name.
  The current pick has an `accent` border and `selected` background.

## How it behaves

- **working**: walks. Picks a random spot at least 60 px away, faces that
  way (side-walking animation), walks there at 70 px/s, pauses 0.3–1.8 s,
  repeats.
- **idle**: strolls at 32 px/s with 4–12 s pauses, standing (idle
  animation, facing the viewer slightly left or right, the way it last
  walked) between strolls. After 3 minutes without a change in its tab
  (`changed_at`), it lies down and sleeps (sleep animation + `zZz`).
  A null `changed_at` (nothing changed since Herdr started) counts as idle
  all along: it sleeps.
- **blocked**: stops where it is (mid-walk too), stands, `!` bubble; its tag
  wins over neighbours.
- **done**: stops, stands, `✓` bubble. Herdr turns `done` into `idle` once
  the person looks at the tab.
- **Click**: `pane.focus { pane }`: Herdr shows that agent's tab and pane
  (`agent.focus { terminal }` for a sub-agent, which has no pane).
- **Right-click**: opens the picker for that agent. Click a Pokémon (or type
  until one is left and press Enter, the input's `submit` event) to choose;
  Esc closes. Search matches names and numbers (`25`, `#025`). The choice is
  saved per pane in shared state, so it survives restarts and a new agent in
  the same pane keeps the same Pokémon.
- **New agents** get a Pokémon from a hash of their pane id, skipping ones
  already on screen, and that pick is saved at once so it never shifts.
- **Key** (optional, `keys.json`): `alt-shift-p` → `pokemon-agents.pick`
  opens the picker for the focused agent (else the first one).

## Built from

- **Layout**: one block `{ "id": "pokemon-agents", "type": "block",
  "content": { "mod": "pokemon-agents" }, "size": { "px": 112 }, "min": 72,
  "max": 240 }` placed in the main (`work`) column, below the tab content and
  above the status bar. `mod.json` is `{ "place": "bottom", "size": 112 }`;
  in a layout whose root is a row, Herdr docks it as a right-hand column
  instead, so move the block into the column by hand.
- **One mod, two roles**: `mods/pokemon-agents/main.js` draws the strip, and
  the same mod opened with `openOverlay({ mod: "pokemon-agents", kind:
  "dialog", width: 640, height: 560, props: { picker: true, slot, current,
  tag } })` draws the picker. It decides which in `init` from `props().picker`.
- **herdr functions**: `agents()`, `spaces()` (tab `named` / `changed_at`),
  `theme()`, `run("pane.focus")` / `run("agent.focus")`, `shared` / `setShared("pokemon-agents",
  { panes: { <pane id>: <dex no> } })` (oldest entries dropped past 300),
  `openOverlay` / `closeOverlay`, `nextCommand()` (`pick`), `exec`, `appHome()`,
  `fs/promises` (`exists`, `mkdir`, `readFile`, `writeFile`).
- **Motion**: one `cx.timer.every(250)` that only calls `cx.notify()` when a
  walk starts or ends, a mood changes, or an agent comes or goes. Each
  Pokémon's 128 px column is absolutely positioned with
  `.transition("left", { duration: <walk time>, easing: "linear" })`, so the
  walk itself is native. Sprite frames are animated GIFs (`image()` plays
  them); bubbles use `.loop("opacity")` and `.frames()`.
- **Art, fetched at first use** into `~/.config/herdr-app/data/pokemon-agents/`
  (nothing Pokémon ships in the repo):
  - Sprites: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PMDCollab/SpriteCollab/master/sprite/<0025>/`
    `AnimData.xml`, `Walk-Anim.png`, `Idle-Anim.png`, `Sleep-Anim.png` (follow
    `<CopyOf>`: some Idle animations are copies of Walk). Sheets have one
    row per facing: 0 down, 1 down-right, 2 right, 6 left, 7 down-left.
    Cut `walkR` (row 2), `walkL` (6), `idleR` (1), `idleL` (7), `sleep` (0,
    or the last row if fewer) with ImageMagick:
    `magick sheet.png -crop <n·fw>x<fh>+0+<row·fh> +repage -crop <fw>x<fh> +repage -scale 200% -set delay '%[fx:t==0?13:t==1?17:…]' -set dispose Background -loop 0 out.gif`
    (durations are 1/60 s game frames, GIF delays 1/100 s). Then measure the
    visible box with `-coalesce -background none -flatten -format %@ info:`
    and store sizes and boxes in `meta.json`, written last as the "done" mark.
  - Picker icons: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/versions/generation-vii/icons/<id>.png`,
    all 151 in one `curl --parallel` call, then one `magick mogrify -scale 200%`.
- **Programs it runs**: `curl`, `magick` (or ImageMagick 6's
  `convert` / `identify` / `mogrify`).

## Watch out

- **Network and programs**: the mod downloads from raw.githubusercontent.com
  and runs `curl` and ImageMagick. It writes only under
  `~/.config/herdr-app/data/pokemon-agents/`. Say so before installing.
- Don't draw an image before its file exists: render the Poké Ball until
  `loadSprite` resolves, so a missing file is never cached as broken.
- `init(props, cx)`'s first argument isn't the overlay's props; read
  `props()` to tell the picker from the strip.
- An agent can briefly have no `pane` when it appears: don't persist picks
  keyed by anything but a pane id, or that agent's Pokémon will change once
  the pane shows up.
- `transition("left")` animates from the last drawn position, so the
  element needs a stable `.id()` per agent, and a stop mid-walk must
  compute the current position (`from + (target − from) · progress`).
- Herdr's `done` becomes `idle` as soon as the tab is seen, so the `✓` is
  short-lived on the shown tab.
- Limits: 151 Pokémon; up to ~1 Pokémon per 128 px of width before they
  crowd (tags then hide). exec calls time out after 30 s; one sprite needs
  ~4 small downloads, and failures retry after a minute.
- Tested on Linux with ImageMagick 7 and Herdr app 0.1.12; macOS and Windows
  need `curl` and ImageMagick on PATH.

## Done when

- `herdr-app check mods/pokemon-agents` passes.
- With agents running, each one has a Pokémon in the bottom strip within a
  few seconds of first use (Poké Balls until the art is ready); a second start
  is instant (cached).
- A working agent walks left and right facing the way it moves; an idle one
  strolls rarely and, 3 minutes after its last change, sleeps with `zZz`.
- An agent waiting for permission stops and shows a pulsing `!`, and its
  name tag stays visible next to a crowd.
- Clicking a Pokémon shows its agent; right-clicking opens the picker with
  151 icons; searching "pika" leaves Pikachu, Enter or a click picks it, and
  the strip shows the new Pokémon. After restarting Herdr it is still there.
- `alt-shift-p` (with the `keys.json` snippet) opens the picker for the
  focused agent.
