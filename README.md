# herdr-pokemon-agents

A [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) mod: every agent is a pixel-art Pokémon (the first
151) roaming a strip at the bottom of the window. Working agents walk, idle ones
stroll and nap, blocked ones stop and call for you. Click a Pokémon to jump to
its agent, right-click to choose which Pokémon it is.

## Install

Ask your agent: *"add the Herdr mod at github.com/mathieucroset/herdr-pokemon-agents"*.
Or by hand:

```sh
cp -r mods/pokemon-agents ~/.config/herdr-app/mods/
herdr-app check ~/.config/herdr-app/mods/pokemon-agents
```

Then put a `{ "type": "block", "content": { "mod": "pokemon-agents" }, "size": { "px": 112 } }`
at the bottom of your layout's main column (see [RECIPE.md](RECIPE.md)).
Optional key: merge [keys.json](keys.json) (`alt-shift-p` opens the picker).

Set `content.props.scale` to a positive number to resize the Pokémon relative
to their current size (`1` by default, `0.5` for half size, `2` for double):

```json
{
  "type": "block",
  "content": { "mod": "pokemon-agents", "props": { "scale": 1.5 } },
  "size": { "px": 160 }
}
```

Shadows and loading Poké Balls scale with the sprites; name tags and picker
icons keep their size. Missing or invalid scales fall back to `1`. Increase
the block height when enlarging Pokémon to leave room above their heads.

Needs `curl` and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) on PATH.

## What it reaches

On first use the mod downloads sprites and icons from raw.githubusercontent.com
into `~/.config/herdr-app/data/pokemon-agents/` and cuts them into GIFs with
ImageMagick. It doesn't read anything else and sends nothing anywhere.
